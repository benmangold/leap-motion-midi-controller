## Functionality

The LEAP's raw output is processed and scaled for reliability within the Pure Data patch 'pd-leap-midi-controller.pd'.

MIDI output is sent from Pd application, which allows routing to a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) (Ex. Ableton Live, Pro Tools) or external hardware via a MIDI output.
