LEAP Midi Controller

by Ben Mangold

This project is meant to turn the LEAP motion into a MIDI controller for music production and performance.  

By parsing and preprocessing the LEAP's many information streams, much more reliable motion detection is achieved.  

In Mac OSX, this patch uses the internal IAC bus to send Midi CC to any receptical DAW, for instance Ableton Live.
